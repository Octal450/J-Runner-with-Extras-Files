## How to use

[!IMPORTANT]
Systems that use 16mb NAND chips must put the "Filesystems" folder on the root of the hard drive for full system functionality. Otherwise, the system will only be able to boot to xshell

Unlike other RGLoader patches, it's not mandatory to do anything else but flash the image. If you've got a favourite `rgloader.ini` place it on the hard drive or a USB stick to override the default in flash.
